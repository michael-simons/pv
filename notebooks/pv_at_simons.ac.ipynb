    "This is a quick overview over our photovoltaics installation in Aachen. We started planning this in September 2022. Originally, I didn't want to put too much thought and effort into analyzing the result, but it turned out: The smart devices vendors sell you are still not that smart, even in 2023. So here I am, collecting measurements straight from our SunSpec compatible inverter over Modbus and dumping it straight into a [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org) analytical database. The [logger](https://github.com/michael-simons/pv/tree/main/logger) I created for that purpose is based on the [Energy systems reading toolkit](https://energy.basjes.nl) by [Niels Basjes](https://mastodon.basjes.nl/@niels). \n",

Instead of writing down all the analytic queries straight into the notebook or my programming environment of choice, I created a bunch of views that basically represents the api of my scheme.

Turns out, it is easy enough with DuckDB 0.8.0 and its excellent support for the `PIVOT` statement (See the corresponding view [`average_production_per_month_and_hour`](https://github.com/michael-simons/pv/blob/main/sql/schema/R__Create_view_average_production_per_month_and_hour.sql). Together with the \"Styler\" feature of Pandas and the integraded color maps of matplotlib you get a colorized table based on the value of the cells with zero effort. In the below example I drop the original dataframe index column and use my `Hour` column instead. It is on purpose that it doesn't get a color."

Therefor we only have the hypothetical full export back into the grid for the first couple of months. The actual partial export computes the amortization by the compensation we get plus the money we saved for not having to import energy. The compensation for a full export to the grid is slightly higher than for a partial one. However, as of writing, I buy nearly for tripple the amount than I could sell at, even for the full export compensation.
