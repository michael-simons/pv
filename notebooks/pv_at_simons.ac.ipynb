    "This is a quick overview over our photovoltaics installation in Aachen. We started planning this in September 2022. Originally, I didn't want to put too much thought and effort into analyzing the result, but it turned out: The smart devices vendors sell you are still not that smart, even in 2023. So here I am, collecting measurements straight from our SunSpec compatible inverter over Modbus and dumping it straight into a [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org) analytical database. The [logger](https://github.com/michael-simons/pv/tree/main/logger) I created for that purpose is based on the [Energy systems reading toolkit](https://energy.basjes.nl) by [Niels Basjes](https://mastodon.basjes.nl/@niels). \n",

    "The database design follows a subset of the [pink database design](https://www.salvis.com/blog/2018/07/18/the-pink-database-paradigm-pinkdb/#feature_3). Instead of writing down all the analytic queries straight into the notebook or my programming environment of choice, I created a bunch of views that basically represents the api of my scheme. Please visit the above lined repository for more information.\n",

As reference, I added the current prices we have for buying a kWh electric energy into the database. The price has seen a whooping increase of more than 75% since 2010:"
